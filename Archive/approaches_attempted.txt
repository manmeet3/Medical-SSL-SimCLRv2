1) Naively fit alzheimers dataset on pretrained models of imagenet (just out of curiousity)

2) Pre-train, finetune and distill using the existing SIMCLR codebase - led to poor results. See colab simclr_alzheimers_*.ipynb. Main issue was that the existing colabs provided did not
sufficiently provide working examples with satisfactory accuracy.

3) Implement the Simclr methodlogy from scratch based on the referenced material inside the coalbs
